    <h1>Gui Graph Editor</h1>
    <p>Gui Graphs describe the basic operaional view on the system under test.
      The model is based on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Petri net</span>s
      plus several extensions. A Petri net consists of three fundamental
      elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Places </span>consitute a partitial
        state. A place can be filled with multiple tokens. An assignment of
        tokens the a subset of places of a Petri net is a marking and, thus, a
        state.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transitions </span>define behavior.</li>
      <li>(Directed) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arcs </span>can be
        connect a Place with a Transition but never two entities of the same
        type. An arc has a <span style="font-weight: bold;">weight </span>to
        define how many tokens are transferred on this specific arc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We say, transitions get activated if all places from incoming arcs are
      filled with enough tokens for each arc's weight. Then the transition may
      fire by removing these tokens and putting new tokens in places that are
      connected by output arcs in the respective number of the arcs' weight.</p>
    <p>Petri nets are not Turing-complete. Therefore,<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Inhibitor arcs</span> can be used that are special arcs from places to
      transitions. A transition with with an incoming inhibitor arc can only be
      activated if the respective place is not marked by a <span style="font-weight: bold;">token</span>.</p>
    <p>Besides inhibitor arcs, we added some additional extensions for Gui
      Graphs. Places are provided in two different visual representations and
      transitions are extended with labels, application conditions and time intervals.
      We call the special type of our transitions Condition Action Transitions.</p>
    <h2>Two Types of Places</h2>
    <p>There are two semantically equal types of places:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-widget Nodes</span> and</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Widget Nodes</span> that can
        additionally be associated to screenshots. This can be used to provide
        an additional orientation for the test engineer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Using the property view, an additional number of tokens can be set to
      each place.</p>
    <h2>Labels</h2>
    <p>Lables descibe observable behavior that is executed when a transition
      "fires". Gui Graph labels are defined by the <a href="ActionsLanguage.html">Action
        Language</a>. Define labels by double clicking on the middle compartment
      of a condition action transition.</p>
    <h2>Application Conditions (only in the Adaptivity Testing Version)</h2>
    <p>Application conditions are taken from so-called<span style="font-style: italic;">
        Feature Petri nets</span>. They restrict the activation of each
      transition to a propositional constraint defined in the <a href="RulesLanguage.html">Rules
        Language</a>. Define application conditions by double clicking on the
      upper compartment of a condition action transition.</p>
    <h2>Time Intervals (only in the Adaptivity Testing Version)</h2>
    <p>Time intervals are taken from so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">Time
        Petri nets</span>. They restrict the firering of transitions to a (real)
      time inside the respective interval. The time counter starts as soon as
      the transitions becomes enabled (equal to activation in standard Petri
      nets). You can define a temporal indeterminism with the help of these
      intervals. They can be changed in the property view after selecting the
      respecitve transition.</p>
    <h2>Clocking Transitions</h2>
    <p>Clocking transitions work like standard transitions of Inhibitor Arc Petri
      nets plus that they produce logic time in order to control timed
      environment models (so-called <span style="font-weight: bold;">consumers</span>).
      Clocking transitions have activation time intervals as well. In the
      property view the amount of produced logical time can be defined as well
      as a specific consumer. If no consumer is defined,<span style="font-style: italic;">
        all consumers in the model's resource set are run</span>.</p>
